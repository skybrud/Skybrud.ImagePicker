# Image

The **Skybrud Image** property extends Umbraco's Media Picker V2, which allows picking either a single media or multiple media.

Each selected media is by default returned as an instance of `Image`, but the type may be changed by selecting a [valye type](./../configuration/value-type/) on the data type.
